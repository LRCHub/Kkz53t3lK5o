Duction to "Incarnation Blues")

This one's for the puffers and the scribblers in the lot
Save for whom the rose that blooms would be the flower time forgot
And the holy hell (they caught)

Knew we'd never stand a chance
We were slave to circumstance
Maybe we'd have seen it through
If you were me and I was you
Out of mind and body too
Got the incarnation blues

Know we'll never meet again
But in this life, you were a friend
So I'll hold out for the next
Won't be so sorrowed, cursed and vexed
Out of mind and body too
Got the incarnation blues
'Cause time moves slowly
When you're alone with no way to be loved
