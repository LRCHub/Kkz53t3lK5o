Pray in the name of a bleeding corpse*
Once a master, now hes hanging on the cross
Conjuring powers, of the light that fades away
This darkness has become reality, now burn with me

Feel the flames
Smell the flesh
Death is your final request

Live by a book you cannot trust
Pages written in disgust, despising every word
Lies of a god who doesn't save
Distorted and depraved, believe his words and be a slave

Feel the flames
Smell the flesh
Death is your final request

Down on their knees for a dead entity
Christ on a cross is the way it must be
Fire consuming the souls of the dead
Hell is the paradise left in their heads

Feel the flames
Smell the flesh
Death is your final request

Dying - incarnation of impurity
Dying - incarnation of impurity
Burning - incarnation of impurity

Pray in the name of a bleeding corpse
Once a master, now hes hanging on the cross
Conjuring powers, of the light that fades away
This darkness has become reality, now burn with me

Feel the flames
Smell the flesh
Death is your final request

Smell the flesh
Feel the flames
Ashes will remain
